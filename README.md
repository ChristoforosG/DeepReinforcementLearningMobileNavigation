In this thesis, we study autonomous vehicle navigation using deep reinforcement learning algorithms. 
The problem we encountered, relates to navigating in a continuous space area with the vehicle receiving 
measurements from the environment and adjusting its speed accordingly. Specifically, we designed three 
reinforcement learning models (DQN, REINFORCE, A2C) and compared their performance in various environments. 
In particular, the task of the autonomous vehicle is to approach a specific goal point in maps with 
or without obstacles.
